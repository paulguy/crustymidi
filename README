crustymidi
MIDI event scripting for JACK

USAGE:
crustymidi <script file>

Script command documentation in commands.txt

midi.inc can be included for some useful constants

crustymidi defines some callbacks:

Read callbacks:
length  - get length of incoming event
data:n  - read data at position n
time    - get timestamp of event.  JACK events are 64 bits so this will only
          return the low 32 bits.
rate    - the current JACK rate

write callbacks:
length  - set length for new event
data:n  - write data in to event
time    - samples from now that event should trigger
commit  - 0(commit_pass) to pass on the input event as-is,
          1(commit_new) to provide a new event
timer   - when a value is written to this, an event will be triggered with
          command 0xF8(midi_cmd_time_clock) the given number of samples from now

for more information, check the example files, and knowledge of MIDI protocol
is necessary.
