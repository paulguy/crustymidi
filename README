crustymidi
MIDI event scripting for JACK

USAGE:
crustymidi <script file>

Script command documentation in commands.txt

midi.inc can be included for some useful constants

crustymidi defines some callbacks:

Read callbacks:
length  - get length of incoming event
data:n  - read data at position n
port    - the port the event came on
time    - get timestamp of event.  JACK events are 64 bits so this will only
          return the low 32 bits.
rate    - the current JACK rate

write callbacks:
length  - set length for new event
data:n  - write data in to event
port    - specify which port the data should go out to
time    - samples from now that event should trigger
commit  - 0(commit_pass) to pass on the input event as-is,
          1(commit_new) to provide a new event
timer   - when a value is written to this, an event will be triggered with
          command 0xF8(midi_cmd_time_clock) the given number of samples from now

A file may start with a string ";crustymidi " (treated as a comment to the
interpreter) where some space separated parameters may be defined.  For now you
can use it to specify input and output ports.  These can be specified by
"in:name" and "out:name" to specify input and output ports with a specified
name.  This is what will appear to JACK.  To the script, they will just be
numbered with each set starting from 0.

for more information, check the example files, and knowledge of MIDI protocol
is necessary.
